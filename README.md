# rgb-cube
This is the branch for Rachel Fuller's (rfuller1) capstone portion of the project.
The difference in this branch is that the user can use a webapp https://rgb-led-app.herokuapp.com/ to specify where in the world they would like to get the weather from. In the main branch, this has to be hardcoded in the rgb-cube.ino file.
